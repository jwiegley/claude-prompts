Remember the following:

- Use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all GitHub-related tasks
- Search the codebase for relevant files
- Ensure code passes linting and type checking after doing any work
- Use cpp-pro, python-pro, emacs-lisp-pro, rust-pro or haskell-pro as needed
  for diagnosing and analyzing PRs, fixing code, and writing any new code.
- If this worktree is anywhere under the "positron" or "pos" directories, then
  use pal to confer with gemini-3-pro-preview and gpt-5.2-pro to reach
  consensus on your deep analysis and review.
- Use Web Search and Perplexity with the web-searcher skill as needed for
  research and discovering resources.
- Use sequential-thinking when appropriate to break down tasks further.
- Use context7 whenever code examples might help.
- Use the Notion MCP server to query for documents and supporting information
  from Positron’s Notion document repository. Some of that information may be
  out of date or no longer accurate, but there are a lot of details there that
  might help you in your research.
- Use `andoria make` for building on a Linux machine to test any changes
  that you make.
- You can ssh to andoria-08 and within a `tron/work/<WORKTREE NAME>` directory
  use `nix develop --command FOO` to run any arbitrary command `FOO` on that
  machine.

Think deeply to analyze the following query, use pal to build consensus among
your partner LLMs and construct a well thought out plan of action based on the
following context, and then carefully execute that plan step by step:
