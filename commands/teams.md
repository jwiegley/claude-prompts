- one teammate doing deep research on community best practices
- one teammate doing deep research on prior art and existing solutions
- one teammate on UX
- one on technical architecture
- one on planning and strategy
- one on testing and code coverage
- one on security and code safety
- one on performance and efficiency
- one on documentation and good code comments
- one playing devil's advocate
- one reviewing all work performed by other teams
