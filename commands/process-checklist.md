You have been given a Markdown checklist of tasks in: $ARGUMENTS

For each task that is not checked as completed:

- Verify the task is still incomplete.
- Fully implement or resolve the item, and confirm it is complete.
- Check off the item in the checklist.
- Repeat for the next item until all are complete.

After finishing, self-verify the list for missed or incomplete tasks and repeat as needed until the checklist is totally complete.
