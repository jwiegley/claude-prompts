**Task:** Review and correct English language errors in all Markdown, Org-mode and other text files within this project.

**Corrections to make:**
1. **Spelling errors** - Fix all typos and misspellings
2. **Grammar issues** - Correct only clear grammatical errors such as:
   - Subject-verb agreement problems
   - Incorrect verb tenses
   - Missing or misused articles (a, an, the)
   - Run-on sentences and comma splices
   - Incorrect punctuation usage

**Important guidelines:**
- **Preserve the author's voice** - Maintain the original tone, style, and personality of the writing
- **Minimal intervention** - Only correct clear errors; do not rewrite sentences for style preferences
- **Keep technical terms** - Do not alter specialized terminology, code snippets, or proper nouns
- **Maintain formatting** - Preserve all markdown formatting, links, and code blocks exactly as they appear
- **Document changes** - For each file modified, briefly note the types of corrections made (e.g., "Fixed 3 spelling errors, 2 comma splices")

**Do NOT change:**
- Stylistic choices (e.g., Oxford commas, sentence fragments used for effect)
- Informal language or colloquialisms if they appear intentional
- Technical jargon or domain-specific terminology
- URLs, file paths, or code examples
- British vs. American spelling (maintain whichever is used consistently)

**Output format:**
For each corrected file, provide the corrected version and append a summary comment at the end listing the number and types of corrections made.
