Use the forge skill to perform a comprehensive multi-model collaborative workflow on the following problem:

$ARGUMENTS

Execute all five phases of the forge workflow in sequence:
1. Deep Analysis & Research (Opus + PAL consensus with GPT-5.2-Pro and Gemini 3 Pro)
2. Strategic Planning (Opus + PAL consensus; present plan for user approval)
3. Execution (Sonnet agent; code editing + running tests)
4. Comprehensive Review (Opus + PAL consensus + codereview)
5. Devil's Advocate Critique (Opus + PAL adversarial consensus)

Do NOT pause between phases except at the end of Phase 2 to get user approval of the execution plan. Work continuously through all phases.
