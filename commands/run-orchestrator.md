Use task-orchestrator to analyze and coordinate work

The orchestrator will:
1. Check task dependencies
2. Identify tasks that can run in parallel
3. Deploy executors for available work
4. Monitor progress and deploy new executors as tasks complete

Use task-executor for specific task implementation

When the orchestrator identifies task 2.3 needs work: The executor will implement that specific task

Do not pause your work to ask if I would like to review or continue. Work continuously until the entire project is completed. Commit your work to Git after each time you reach a point where no tasks are currently running, just before you begin the next task.
