Use $ARGUMENTS and thoroughly review the code in this repository, looking for correctness, security, performance, adherence to community best practices, use of best-in-class supporting packages and libraries, reducing code duplication, opporutinities to simplify or streamline, and any areas where an artful use of abstraction might actually reduce complexity and aid in all of the above.

I want to perform a very comprehensive and thorough analysis and review of this code base using $ARGUMENTS. I want you to look for opportunities to improve the structure, clarify the code and its intent, to clean up some of the code, streamline it, remove duplication or anything that's unnecessary while keeping all of the current functionality of course. I want you to reduce any duplication in the prompts, the system prompts or the schema definition that's being sent to Claude (where applicable). I just want to tighten things up and make this a more effective application without removing or taking away anything that it currently does because it's working great and I don't want to break it and I don't want to take away any of its existing functionality. I just know that we haven't done a thorough review like this in some time and so now it's a good chance to take stock, do a exhaustive code review, check for code coverage, create some tests that will help us validate the code before we push new releases into production and just overall look for opportunities to clean up, revise any documentation that's come up become out of date, add documentation or comments in places where it doesn't currently exist, look for any obvious security problems or performance issues, review current day community best practices and best of breed libraries for providing facilities that maybe now we've been implementing by hand or doing manually. You know, just overall a really good health checkup.
